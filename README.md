# Javan Warty Pig

Javan Warty Pig, or JWP, is an [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)-like fuzzer for the JVM. It uses bytecode
instrumentation to trace execution. It is written in Java.

There was [an earlier version](https://github.com/cretz/javan-warty-pig-kotlin) started in Kotlin and Kotlin Native
using single-step [JVMTI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/specs/jvmti.html), but it was abandoned.
